# 🌸 Stage 0 – Profile Card Project

This is my **Stage 0 Frontend Project** for the **Internship X program**.  
It’s a simple **personal profile card** built using only **vanilla HTML and CSS** to demonstrate:
- Semantic and accessible web structure
- Clean, readable code
- Responsive and visually appealing layout

- Understand and apply **semantic HTML elements** like `<article>`, `<figure>`, and `<section>`
- Practice **accessibility basics** (`alt`, `aria`, keyboard focus)
- Write **secure and optimized links** with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Build confidence with **vanilla front-end development** before using frameworks like React or Next.js
